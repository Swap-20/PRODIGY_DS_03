# üìä Customer Purchase Prediction Using Decision Tree

## üìù Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service, using **demographic** and **behavioral** data. The dataset used is the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing).

## üìÅ Dataset

**Bank Marketing Dataset** contains data related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit.

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Instances**: ~41,000
- **Features**: 16 input variables (categorical and numerical), 1 output (binary: 'yes' or 'no')

## üìà Model

A **Decision Tree Classifier** is used due to its interpretability and effectiveness on tabular data.

### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling categorical features (label encoding / one-hot encoding)
   - Dealing with missing values
   - Feature scaling (if necessary)

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train/Test split (e.g., 80/20)
   - Fit Decision Tree Classifier

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Feature Importance Visualization

## üìä Results

The model achieved promising performance on the test set, showing potential for real-world marketing use cases. Further tuning and testing with ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forests) are possible for improved accuracy.
